# **App Name**: MediMind

## Core Features:

- Patient Data Integration: Ingest and structure patient data (history, symptoms, vitals, labs, medications, imaging summaries, clinical notes) into a unified report.
- Ranked Diagnostic List: Generate a ranked list of likely diagnoses with confidence scores and evidence-based justifications linked to patient data.
- Red-Flag Alerts: Detect urgent conditions (e.g., sepsis, stroke) and generate escalation alerts with urgency levels. Uses an AI tool for pattern matching in the aggregated data to produce output. 
- Risk Stratification: Categorize patients into risk groups (Low/Medium/High) with explainable reasoning based on key drivers.
- Explainability Pack: Provide transparent mapping between AI decisions and underlying clinical data for explainability and auditability.
- Validation Notes: Log clinician reviews and results from synthetic stress testing to ensure system robustness.
- Dashboard: Dashboard interface to present reports, ranked diagnoses, alerts, and risk stratification.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A calming, trustworthy blue (#4A8FE7) to inspire confidence and clarity. Derived from the concepts of 'trust' and 'clarity'.
- Background color: A very light blue-gray (#F0F4F9). It is desaturated in the same hue family as the primary color to maintain a professional and calming feel in the UI, suiting the app’s sensitive and critical usage.
- Accent color: A vibrant purple (#9352B3) for highlights and calls to action. Purple provides an attention-grabbing signal different than the blue, ensuring important features aren’t missed.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern look, will be used throughout.
- Use clear, minimalist icons to represent diagnostic categories, risk levels, and alert types.
- Employ a clean, well-structured layout with clear information hierarchy to support efficient clinician workflows.
- Incorporate subtle animations for transitions and data updates to enhance user experience without causing distractions.
