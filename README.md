# MediMind: AI-Powered Diagnostic & Triage Support System

MediMind is an advanced prototype application demonstrating the use of Generative AI in healthcare. It provides users with a tool for preliminary symptom analysis, detailed medical report interpretation, and a conversational chatbot for medical inquiries. The goal is to empower users with understandable health information and facilitate more productive conversations with healthcare professionals.

## Key Features

-   **Symptom & Report Analysis:** Users can enter their symptoms or upload a medical report (image or PDF) to receive a detailed, AI-powered analysis.
-   **Graphical Biomarker Analysis:** Extracts key biomarkers (e.g., Hemoglobin, Glucose, Blood Pressure) from medical reports and displays them in an intuitive graphical format, comparing user values against normal ranges.
-   **Diagnostic Confidence:** Provides a ranked analysis of possible conditions with confidence scores, presented in a clear bar chart.
-   **Red Flag Detection:** Identifies urgent, life-threatening findings from reports and alerts the user.
-   **Conversational AI Chatbot:** A friendly chatbot (MediMind) to answer medical questions and provide preliminary guidance.
-   **User & Clinician Roles:** Supports two distinct user roles—Patient and Clinician—with a dedicated dashboard for clinicians to view patient data.
-   **Persistent History:** Securely saves a history of all analyses for each user.
-   **Modern, Responsive UI:** Built with the latest web technologies for a seamless experience on any device, including a dark mode theme.

-   **Framework:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
-   **Language:** [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
-   **Generative AI:** [Google's Gemini models](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/) via [Genkit](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit)
-   **UI Components:** [ShadCN UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
-   **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
-   **Animations:** [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or newer recommended)
-   npm or yarn

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-folder>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the `.env.example` file (if it exists) or creating a new one. You will need to add your Google AI (Gemini) API key.

    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key_here
    ```

### Running the Development Server

To run the application in development mode, which includes both the Next.js frontend and the Genkit AI flows, use the following commands.

1.  **Start the Genkit server:**
    This command starts the Genkit server, which makes the AI flows available for the Next.js application to call. It also watches for changes in your AI flow files.

    ```bash
    npm run genkit:watch
    ```

2.  **Start the Next.js frontend:**
    In a separate terminal, run this command to start the Next.js development server.

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. The application will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.
